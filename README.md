# Temperature converter

A simple program that calculates between different temperature scales.
As of now it calculates between Farenheit and Celcius.

## How to run the program:
 
 Compile the `temperature.java` file and run the resulting class.
 
 ```shell
 javac temperature.java
 java temperature
 ```
##  Features:
 - Converting between temperaturescales of your choice.
 - Simple GUI for input.
 - Allows for comand-line input.

##  TODO:
 - build gui
 -- text vs graphic
 - more than Celcius and Farenheit
 - Need MOAR commenting

##  Implemented:
 - A lovely splash-screen.
 - Method for receiving user input.
 - Methodes that convert from Celcius to Farenheit and vice versa.
 - check for commandline input to see if it is correct.
 - Allows floatingpoint input from commandline
